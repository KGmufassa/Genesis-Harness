# Global Stage Readiness Audit

# Purpose

The global stage readiness audit verifies that a stage is ready to hand off to the next stage according to:

```text
System-References/Docs/Global-Stage-Workflow-Contract.md
```

This audit is required at the end of every stage finalization attempt, before the stage writes its final completion status to shared state.

The audit must run for ready, revision-needed, prior-stage-revision, and blocked outcomes.

# Audit Skill

Use:

```text
global-stage-readiness-audit
```

The audit validates:

* required output files exist
* output files follow the expected stage schemas
* completion status exists
* global completion status is mapped
* handoff object exists
* handoff contains enough structured data for the next stage
* risks are recorded
* assumptions are recorded
* blockers are explicit
* traceability IDs exist or missing traceability is justified
* artifact references are recorded when evidence exists
* structural UI architecture, visual, and design continuity checks pass when the stage contains frontend-facing work
* stage contract profile requirements are satisfied
* schema validation results are recorded for required outputs
* accepted risks are recorded in the risk acceptance ledger when progression depends on accepted risk
* cross-stage references are valid, not duplicated, and not stale
* failed readiness conditions produce revision-loop records with owning stage, output, skill, and next action
* Stage 8 feedback routes are owned, evidence-backed, and routed to earlier stages when live findings create a new cycle

# Required Audit Output

Each stage must write:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Stage-X-readiness-audit.json
```

Where `X` is the stage number.

Example:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Stage-5-readiness-audit.json
```

# Readiness Rule

A stage may use a stage-specific ready status only when:

```text
ready_for_next_stage = true
```

Stage 8 is terminal and cyclical. For Stage 8, `ready_for_next_stage = true` means the evolution package is ready to close the current cycle or create routed work for earlier stages through `prior_stage_feedback`; it does not imply a Stage 9 handoff.

For frontend-facing work, the audit must also enforce the structural UI architecture, visual, and design continuity rules in:

```text
System-References/Docs/Global-Stage-Workflow-Contract.md
```

For launch-critical user workflows, the audit must verify workflow outcome
evidence. Contract-only work, API-only work, static UI, fixture-backed runtime
pages, successful builds, and unresolved dead controls do not satisfy readiness.

For evidence-backed readiness claims, the audit must verify related evidence exists in:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Artifact-evidence-registry.json
```

For accepted-risk readiness claims, the audit must verify risk acceptance entries exist in:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Risk-acceptance-ledger.json
```

For every failed or blocked readiness condition, the audit must create a revision-loop object with the owning stage, output, skill, required change, and whether accepted risk is allowed.

If the audit fails, the stage must set completion status to one of:

```text
needs_current_stage_revision
needs_prior_stage_revision
blocked
```

The failed or blocked audit file must still be written and must include `blocking_gaps`, `revision_loops`, and `next_actions`.

# Global Workflow State Update

After each audit, update:

```text
Build-Plans/Build-status/Global-workflow-state.json
```

The workflow state must record:

* stage status
* audit result
* current stage
* blockers
* revision loops
* next recommended action
